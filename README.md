<h1>Creating a Malware Analysis Lab</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project was to create a secure and isolated environment for malware analysis by setting up a Windows 10 virtual machine using VirtualBox and subsequently loading it with VMware. This lab will facilitate both passive and static analysis of malware, to provide a comprehensive understanding of malware behavior and characteristics.
<br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Virtual Box</b> 
- <b>VMware</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b>

<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

First we will need to set up our virtual machine which can be done using an ISO image from https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/software-download/windows10ISO loaded into a new virtual machine in VirtualBox:

<br/>
Once we complete the standard Windows 10 setup we need to configure the VM to remove the standard protections that Windows provides us. This will include disabling Windows update and Windows Defender. We want to reduce these protections so that our malware is not inhibited when we try to analyze it on the VM.

To do this we just need to navigate to the **Run dialog** (Win + R) and input "services.msc". Once we've done this we navigate to **Windows Update** in the list of services and stop the service. We also want to change the startup type to *Disabled* so Windows Update does not re-launch on Startup. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
After this we want to navigate to **Windows Security > Virus and threat protection settings**, and then turn off *Real-time protection, Cloud-delivered protection, Automatic sample submission* and *Tamper protection*.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
After this we will open the Run dialog again and input "gpedit.msc" to access the Local Group Policy Editior. From here, on the left, we will navigate to **Local Computer Policy > Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Microsoft Defender Antivirus**, then select **Real-time Protection** on the right. Within this folder we want to double click **Turn off real-time protection**, and then select *Enabled* and click *Ok*

Next we want to disable Windows Defender :  <br/>
